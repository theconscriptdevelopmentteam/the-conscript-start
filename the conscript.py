 the sludge squelches underfoot, 
 the walls of the trenches are low far too low to provide cover when standing up 
 problem is there are too many people to bend over
 a single stray bullet could end it all 
 and in the second world war every bullet is stray
 ~1 year ago~ 
 You have passed the medical. What is your last name, soldier? 
 |q
q  eh? that was my stepfathers uncles grandpas 
 third cousins twice removeds seventh and final  middle name 
 the whistle of an enemy bomb drowns out your 
  innermost thoughts along with the drone of machine gun fire
 you brace for impact, only to hear the screams of terror and agony from an adjacent trench
 what do you : 
 1, run and hide 
 2, run over the top  and help the wounded 
 3,  run to cover and continue firing 
 4, run and pray 
 5 drop where you are 
 |3
you see 3 enemy troops, one dead and lying limp into the trench, one aiming his rifle directly at your head, and one rushing you with a trench mace
who will you fire on? 
 1. the enemy soldier's corpse, 
 2.the rifleman 
 3. the soldier with the mace 
 |3
you line up the shot, pull the trigger and see him fall to the ground gripping his wrist as he bleeds out; the rifleman is killed by your machine gunner before he can pull the trigger
